I am a business analyst, working mostly for requirements, both business and software. I test application both functional and business process correctness. At the end, documentation await me. Pretty boring, but well sometimes I can fix one or two bugs and add one or two features when my developer team has difficulty regarding people size.

I wrote not only in tech, but also in any kind of entertainment (music, movie, games, food), politics and finance, etc. So don't expect this blog to be one of full-technical blog.

I might post a project or two here, but most of my projects are private one :D. Sorry 'bout that.
