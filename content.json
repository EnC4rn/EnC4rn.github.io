But hell, who even able to resist the temptation of CLI controlled blogging, where you can just write everything within your Vim and then push it to the blog using command line? I am one of people that choose the more painful no GUI approach to use an application. Not that I am a super user or high level coder. I’m an analyst, always be, but I too am a coder, even tough I code less than analysing client’s demand. I hope this blog can live all forever because I of the great theme ‘icarus’ that I don’t even need to customise the theme further. When I use ghost, I spent more time dealing with themes than actually write something. If you find my writings and opinions are interesting, please do comment and give feedback to me.
